# üöÄ Join Our Team!


## About Us
Edgee is an edge platform designed to transform how workloads and data are processed across the internet.

Edgee empowers developers to build and deploy edge-oriented applications. This approach to application development harnesses the potential of edge computing, enabling workloads to run closer to users than ever before.

## Cultural fit
- **Builder spirit**. We still have a lot to build and need people that can deliver ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù software and iterate quickly.
- **Generalist**. At this stage, specialists are a risk. We need to be flexible with regard to our stack options and a good candidate will be able to pick up new technologies and skills quickly as necessary.
- **Good communication skills**. We‚Äôre a distributed team with flexible hours. The lack of in-person contact must be overcome by excellent communication.

## Hiring process
All meetings are conducted remotely through Zoom or Google Meet and are 1 hour long, except the Technical fit interview, which takes 1.5 hours. You can expect the following, with regard to the interview process:

- **Pre-screening:** Together with your CV, please send us a note telling why you might be a good fit for this role. 
- **Screening interview:** If your profile fits, we‚Äôll get in touch with you for a first video call. Here we expect to learn more about your background and motivations.
- **Technical fit interview:** The next step is to have a live coding session with our CTO [Alex Gravem](https://github.com/kvpan). You‚Äôll work together on a problem closely related to the scope of the team.
- **Team fit Interview with the co-CEOs:** Next you‚Äôll meet separately both of our co-CEOS [Sacha Morard](https://github.com/sachamorard) and [Gilles Raymond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillesraymondmobile/)

In parallel to the interviews we‚Äôll be conducting a reference check with 2 people of your choosing who you‚Äôre working with or have worked with in the past.



At Edgee, we're pioneering the future of edge computing, transforming how data is processed. We're looking for passionate, innovative minds to join us on this exciting journey.
