# üöÄ Join Our Team!


## About Us
Edgee is an edge platform designed to transform how workloads and data are processed across the internet.

Edgee empowers developers to build and deploy edge-oriented applications. This approach to application development harnesses the potential of edge computing, enabling workloads to run closer to users than ever before.

## Cultural fit
- **Builder spirit**. We still have a lot to build and need people that can deliver ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù software and iterate quickly.
- **Generalist**. At this stage, specialists are a risk. We need to be flexible with regard to our stack options and a good candidate will be able to pick up new technologies and skills quickly as necessary.
- **Good communication skills**. We‚Äôre a distributed team with flexible hours. The lack of in-person contact must be overcome by excellent communication.
